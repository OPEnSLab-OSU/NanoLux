The Audiolux is a product developed by Portland-based company CymaSpace that visualizes music or other performing arts on LED strips, enabling the deaf and hard of hearing to participate in these events. The Audiolux 1 is a pre-existing product, so the goal of this project is to make improvements such as adding user configurable modes, increasing the number of visualization patterns on the LEDs, making configuration wireless, and improving accuracy of pitch detection.
