### Be Printable ###
This manual should be under 30 pages, which is printable on consumer printers.
### Be Explanatory ###
This manual should try to explain topics without requiring readers to read excessive amounts of code.
### Be Visual ###
This manual should use images and diagrams to explain topics when text explanations fail.
### Be Appealing ###
This manual should appear presentable and professional.

### Clean Code Policy ###

The original writer of this manual believes two things about clean code:

- Clean code is possible to write.
- Everyone is capable of writing clean code.

Clean code enables developers to write code faster, especially during the typical on boarding process. Clean code is typically modular and easy to configure or modify. Clean code often utilizes elements of object-oriented programming, such as functions and structures.
