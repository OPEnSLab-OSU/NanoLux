* STRIP AND PATTERN CONFIGURATIONS
*
* In the NanoLux codebase, the term "pattern" refers to the
* individual light pattern running on part of the LED strip.
* Therefore, in the case of strip splitting, up to PATTERN_LIMIT
* could run side-by-side. Each pattern has other data besides
* the pattern index, which includes a brightness value and a
* smoothing value.
*
* The term "strip config" refers to everything currently running on 
* the strip. Each strip config contains patterns within
* them, and have extra data that pertains to the entire LED strip
* or audio analysis module that cannot run multiple times. Of note
* is the number of patterns that pattern is currently running.
